This is bcron, a new cron system designed with secure operations in
mind.  To do this, the system is divided into several seperate programs,
each responsible for a seperate task, with strictly controlled
communications between them.  The user interface is a drop-in
replacement for similar systems (such as vixie-cron), but the internals
differ greatly.

Requirements:

- Needs ucspi-unix (or ucspi-local) to be able to accept user-submitted
  crontabs.
- bglibs version 1.100 or later from http://untroubled.org/bglibs/

Installation:

- Edit the configuration in the conf-* files as necessary.
- Build the sources by running "make".
- Install the package by running "make install" as root.

Configuration:

- Create a system user and group "cron".  This user will own all the
  crontab files.

- Create the spool directory as follows:
  mkdir -p /var/spool/cron/crontabs /var/spool/cron/tmp
  mkfifo /var/spool/cron/trigger
  for i in crontabs tmp trigger; do
    chown cron:cron /var/spool/cron/$i
    chmod go-rwx /var/spool/cron/$i
  done

- Create the configuration directory /etc/bcron as follows:
  mkdir -p /etc/bcron
  You can put any common configuration settings into this directory,
  like alternate spool directories in BCRON_SPOOL.

Operation:

- The scheduler can be started with the following command:
  envdir /etc/bcron bcron-start | multilog t /var/log/bcron &

- To accept crontabs from users, run the spooler:
  envdir /etc/bcron \
  envuidgid cron \
  unixserver -U /var/run/bcron-spool \
  bcron-spool >/dev/null 2>&1 &

- To update system crontabs, run the updater:
  envdir /etc/bcron \
  bcron-update /etc/crontab /etc/cron.d >/dev/null 2>&1 &

- Sample run scripts are provided for operating the above commands under
  svscan and supervise (or equivalents such as runit).
